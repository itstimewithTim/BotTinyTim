# BotTinyTim
This is where i keep all the code that makes Tiny Tim work !

This consists of a main.py where i only keep the bare minimum code that allows TinyTim to function,
a checks.py where i have listed certain roles that might be needed in order to perform certain bot commands,
and Cogs that each contain a different module of commands/features.
